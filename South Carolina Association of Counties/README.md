Planning and zoning training requirements are governed by the South Carolina Planning Education Advisory Committee (SCPEAC).
The South Carolina Association of Counties’ Institute of Government for County Officials provides the knowledge and skills that policymakers 
and executive staff need to address critical issues, meet the daily needs of their communities, and monitor the county’s performance.
The Association provides orientation training and continuing education that addresses current issues and changes in state law. 
One course fulfills the annual planning/zoning continuing education requirement.
Certificates of completion are emailed to the individual upon completion of the class.
